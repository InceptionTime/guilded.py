API Reference
===============

The following section outlines the API of guilded.py.

.. note::

    This module uses the Python logging module to log diagnostic and errors
    in an output independent way. If the logging module is not configured,
    these logs will not be output anywhere. See :doc:`logging` for
    more information on how to set up and use the logging module.

Version Related Info

Event Reference
---------------

This section outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`Client`.

If an event handler raises an exception, :func:`on_error` will be called
to handle it, which defaults to print a traceback and ignoring the exception.

.. _event-experiment:

You may be interested in the `opt-in event style experiment <https://www.guilded.gg/guilded-api/blog/updates/Event-style-experiment>`_,
which is available post-version 1.3.0. If you have this experiment enabled,
event handlers that correspond to real gateway messages will receive an
instance of a :class:`BaseEvent` subclass as their single parameter.
This is denoted below with notes linking back to this section.

.. warning::

    Event functions must be a |coroutine_link|_.

Debug
~~~~~~

.. function:: on_error(event, *args, **kwargs)

    Usually when an event raises an uncaught exception, a traceback is
    printed to stderr and the exception is ignored. If you want to
    change this behaviour and handle the exception for whatever reason
    yourself, this event can be overridden. Which, when done, will
    suppress the default action of printing the traceback.

    The information of the exception raised and the exception itself can
    be retrieved with a standard call to :func:`sys.exc_info`.

    If you want exception to propagate out of the :class:`Client` class
    you can define an ``on_error`` handler consisting of a single empty
    :ref:`py:raise`. Exceptions raised by ``on_error`` will not be
    handled in any way by :class:`Client`.

    :param event: The name of the event that raised the exception.
    :type event: :class:`str`

    :param args: The positional arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.
    :param kwargs: The keyword arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.

.. function:: on_socket_raw_receive(msg)

    Called whenever a message is received from the gateway. The data provided

    does anything else with the data.

~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client has connected to the gateway and filled its internal cache automatically.

    .. warning::

        This event will be called multiple times thoughout a process's lifetime when the client

Guilded Models
---------------

Models are classes that are constructed using data recieved directly from
Guilded and are not meant to be created by the user of the library.

.. danger::

    The classes listed below are **not intended to be created by users**.

    For example, this means that you should not make your own :class:`User`
    instances nor should you modify a :class:`User` instance yourself.

    If you want to get one of these model classes instances they'd have to be
    through the cache, and a common way of doing so is through the :meth:`utils.find`
    function or attributes of model classes that you receive from the events
    specified in the Event Reference.
